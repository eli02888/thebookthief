	- **Caption**: This drawing made around 1623 shows slaves doing all of the tasks involved in creating sugar: Under the hot sun, they harvest the crop (top right); the cut stalks are gathered into bundles (front right) and carried to the mill (right); the cane is ground under a turning wheel (left center), then poured into vats to be boiled (left front); sugar crystals are then ladled into jars to cool (left center). No real mill would have looked exactly like this. The picture was meant to show the whole sugar cycle at a glance. (LIBRARY OF CONCRESS)

On a signal given (as the beat of a drum), the buyers rush at once into the yard where the slaves are confined, and make choice of that parcel that they like best.'
	  'Their huts, which ought to be well covered, and the place dry where they take their little repose, are often open sheds, built in damp places; so that when the poor creatures return tired from the toils of the field, they contract many disorders, from being exposed to the damp air in this uncomfortable state.'"
