## Description
- **Excerpt from pg. 40**: "The first thing they did there was make sure your "heil Hitler" was working properly. Then you were taught to march straight, roll band- ages, and sew up clothes. You were also taken hiking and on other such activities. Wednesday and Saturday were the designated meeting days, from three in the afternoon until five."
