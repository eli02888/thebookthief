## Background
- Lives in Germany
- Born around January 1929
	- 11 years old (pg. 150)
- Placed into foster care by her mother shortly after her brother's death
    - Foster home was in Molching, on Himmel (meaning heaven) Street
    - Foster family was named the Hubermanns
- [[Mr. Meminger]] was a communist
	- That's the only thing she knows about him
- **Excerpt (pg. 31)**: "Upon her arrival, you could still see the bite marks of snow on her hands and the frosty blood on her fingers. Everything about her was undernourished. Wirelike shins. Coat hanger arms. She did not produce it easily, but when it came, she had a starving smile. Her hair was a close enough brand of German blond, but she had dangerous eyes. Dark brown. You didn't really want brown eyes in Germany around that time. Perhaps she received them from her father, but she had no way of knowing, as she couldn't remember him."
