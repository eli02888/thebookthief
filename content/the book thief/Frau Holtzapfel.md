## Background
- **Excerpt from pg. 44**: Frau Holtzapfel was a wiry woman and quite obviously spiteful. She'd never married but had two sons, a few years older than the Hubermann offspring. Both were in the army and both will make cameo appearances by the time we're finished here, I assure you.
- One of her sons, Robert, died in Russia (pg. 467)
	- She became distant and suicidal afterwards (pgs.  and 485)
- The other hung himself in a laundromat at 6:03 AM on July 24th from the guilt, six months later (pg. 502)
## The argument
- Engaged in a longstanding verbal argument with [[Rosa Hubermann]]
- Every time she walks past their house, she spits on their door
- This feud ended in exchange for Liesel reading to her
## The bombing
- Himmel Street was bombed at night, killing her and
	- Rudy
	- the Hubermanns
	- Frau Diller
	- Tommy MÃ¼ller
- Liesel survived
