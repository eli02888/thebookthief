### A brief overview
it was 1936, and Jesse Owens just won his fourth medal in the Olympics. Rudy Steiner, in a rush of inspiration, ran into the kitchen and retrieved a piece of coal from the stove. He coated himself in it, hair too. Riding maxhis brother's bike, he snuck to Hubert Oval (street) and won an imaginary race as Jesse.

The question was repeated, and the very stupid Rudy Steiner, who knew all to well that it was April 20, 1889, answered with the birth of Christ. He even threw in Bethlehem as an added piece of information. Franz smeared his hands together. A very bad sign. He walked over to Rudy and ordered him back outside for some more laps on the field. Rudy ran them alone, and after every lap, he was asked again the date of the FÃ¼her's birthday. He did seven laps before he got it right.
