## General
- pre- and during WWII Germany
- 1939-1942
- **Excerpt from pg. 46**: "On the whole, it was a street filled with relatively poor people, de- spite the apparent rise of Germany's economy under Hitler. Poor sides of town still existed."

## Foster home
### The neighborhood
- **Excerpt from pg. 27**: "The buildings appear to be glued together, mostly small houses and apartment blocks that look nervous. There is murky snow spread out like carpet. There is concrete, empty hat-stand trees, and gray air."
- **Excerpt from pg. 32**: "The Hubermanns lived in one of the small, boxlike houses on Himmel Street. A few rooms, a kitchen, and a shared outhouse with neighbors. The roof was flat and there was a shallow basement for storage. It was supposedly not a basement of adequate depth. In 1939, this wasn't a problem. Later, in '42 and '43, it was. When air raids started, they always needed to rush down the street to a better shelter."
- There are no other children in the house
## The school
- State-run
- Has a heavy catholic influence
	- Liesel is Lutheran
## The road of yellow stars
- **Excerpt from pg. 51**: "It was a place nobody wanted to stay and look at, but almost everyone did. Shaped like a long, broken arm, the road contained several houses with lacerated windows and bruised walls. The Star of David was painted on their doors. Those houses were almost like lepers. At the very least, they were infected sores on the injured German terrain.
  
  "Schiller Strasse," Rudy said. "The road of yellow stars.""
