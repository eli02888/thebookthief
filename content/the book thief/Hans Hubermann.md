## WWI (pg. 175-8)
- Fought in World War I with Erik Vandenburg
- The only one in his group that is still alive because Erik volunteered him to write letters for the captain all morning
- Friends with Erik because of their mutual interest in staying alive
	- They didn't like the fighting
## Characteristics and interests
- The husband of [[Rosa Hubermann]]
- Rarely drinks
	- He has been sober for 10 years (with two exceptions)
		- One was the glass of champaign he had
		- The other was the night before he went to training
			- He and [[Alex Steiner|Alex]] got free drinks (pg. 420)

			- He ends up sleeping in the basement (pg. 421)
- Smokes cigarettes (he rolls his own)
	- **Excerpt from pg. 34**: "He loved to smoke. The main thing he enjoyed about smoking was the rolling. He was a painter by trade and played the piano accordion. This came in handy, especially in winter, when he could make a little money playing in the pubs of Molching, like the Knoller. He had already cheated me in one world war but would later be put into another (as a perverse kind of reward), where he would somehow manage to avoid me again."
- "Walks straight"
- Gentle
	- **Excerpt from pg. 28**: "Outside, through the circle she'd made, Liesel could see the tall man's fingers, still holding the cigarette. Ash stumbled from its edge and lunged and lifted several times until it hit the ground. It took nearly fifteen minutes to coax her from the car. It was the tall man who did it.
	  
	  Quietly."
- Left school in the fourth grade (pg. 39)

- Does not like Hitler
	- **Excerpt from pg. 63**: In 1933, 90 percent of Germans showed unflinching support for Adolf Hitler. That leaves 10 percent who didn't. Hans Hubermann belonged to the 10 percent. There was a reason for that.
		- Because [[Erik Vandenburg]] was Jewish and he saved his life
